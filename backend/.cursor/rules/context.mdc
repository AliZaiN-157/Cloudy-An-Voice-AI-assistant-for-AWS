ALWAYS REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL CONTEXT !!
Input Stream Integrity: Ensure the real-time audio and screen share data streams are delivered to the Gemini Live API without loss or corruption.

Contextual Cohesion: Verify that the Gemini Live API's internal STT, VAD, and VLM outputs are seamlessly combined to form a unified, accurate context for the LLM.

Session State Consistency: Maintain accurate and up-to-date conversational history and session parameters in the database, ensuring the AI's responses are grounded in the ongoing interaction.

Turn-Taking Precision: Strictly adhere to the Gemini Live API's Voice Activity Detection (VAD) signals to correctly identify user speech boundaries and avoid premature responses or interruptions.

Response Fidelity: Ensure the synthesized speech (TTS) from Gemini Live precisely matches the generated textual response, preventing any discrepancy in the AI's spoken output.

Error-Driven Silence: If critical input streams or API responses are incomplete or erroneous, the system should default to clarification or silence rather than generating speculative responses.
